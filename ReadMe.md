## **Vowel Shifter Secret Note Passer (Advanced)** 📝🔒

**Description**:  
Hello Coders! 🌟 Time to delve deeper into the secrets of cryptography. Our Vowel Shifter is evolving! This time, for every uppercase vowel in your message, it will shift forward by a chosen number. For lowercase vowels, it will shift backward. Non-vowels remain untouched.

## **Example**:

**Your Note**: HeLLo World!
**Shift By**: 3

**Encrypted Note**: HoLLi Wnrld!

**Decrypting the Magic**:
```
H remains H (unchanged)
e changes to b (shift backward by 3)
L remains L (unchanged)
L remains L (unchanged)
o changes to l (shift backward by 3)
W remains W (unchanged)
o changes to l (shift backward by 3)
r remains r (unchanged)
l remains l (unchanged)
d remains d (unchanged)
! remains ! (unchanged)
```

## **Implementation**:

```java
public class AdvancedVowelShifterChallenge {

    public String advancedVowelShift(String message, int shift) {
        return null;
    }


}
```
